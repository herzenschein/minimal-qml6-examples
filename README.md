# minimal-qml6-examples

A collection of minimal QML examples.

This repository serves as a learning tool for myself and as easy-to-understand documentation for others.

All examples are built with Qt6 and use the new CMake API for Qt6, even those that use the Qt5 method of doing things.

## Current examples:

* [QML5 Context Property - Exporting C++ data to QML the bad way](qml5-contextproperty)
* [QML6 QML_ELEMENT - Exporting C++ data to QML the good way](qml6-qmlelement)
* [QML6 Pragma Singleton - Exporting a singleton from QML to QML](qml6-pragmasingleton)
* [QML6 Multiengine Singleton - Exporting a C++ singleton to QML](qml6-multienginesingleton)
* [QML6 Subdirectories - Handle QML and C++ to QML over subdirectories](qml6-subdirectories)
