# QML6 Subdirectories - Handle QML and C++ to QML over subdirectories

This is a minimal example to learn how to manage QML files and C++ files exported to QML over multiple subdirectories.

Important reminders:

* This example uses both standard QML files and a multiengine singleton.
* I'm not entirely sure on how `OUTPUT_DIRECTORY` and `IMPORT_PATH` work in the context of `qt_qml_add_module()`, so contributions to clarify this are welcome.
